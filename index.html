		<h2>Susan Wall</h2>
		<p>I graduated from Heritage Academy with college credit, and am now continuing my college education with 
		<a href="http://www.bju.edu/">Bob Jones University</a> Currently, I am not sure of what course of study I will take, but I am thinking about majoring in English.
		</p>
		<p>Many classes and experiences have contributed to my academic interests. In high school, I took creative writing, which assisted in narrowing down my specific writing interests to creative writing. I also took speech and debate, which I very much enjoyed despite my tendencies to be an introvert. In addition to those, I also found an interest in American History. Outside of high school, I have explored my interest in aviation through being a member of the 
		<a href="https://gocivilairpatrol.com/">Civil Air Patrol</a>
		and in attending an aviation camp at Bob Jones University.
		</p>
		<p>A few things I love include writing, reading, and listening to music. I have been reading since I was five and writing since I was seven. I am currently working on writing a novel that will hopefully be the first in a series. My music interests are widely varied and include a large range of genres and artists.
